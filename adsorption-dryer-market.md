<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adsorption Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Simple Adsorption Dryer</li><li>Regenerative Adsorption Dryer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The adsorption dryer market primarily features two types: simple adsorption dryers and regenerative adsorption dryers. Simple adsorption dryers utilize desiccants to capture moisture from the air and require periodic manual replacement or regeneration of the desiccant material. In contrast, regenerative adsorption dryers are designed for continuous operation, regenerating the desiccant using heat or vacuum processes, which allows for a more efficient and sustainable moisture removal. Both types cater to various industrial applications, ensuring optimal air quality and equipment protection.</p></p>
